# cogstyle

> Maintainable CSS for component frameworks

## Usage

### Installation

```
yarn add cogstyle
```

or

```
npm install --save cogstyle
```

### Usage

Check our our example demos in [React](https://stackblitz.com/edit/cogstyle-react?file=cogs.js) and [Angular](https://stackblitz.com/edit/cogstyle-angular?file=app%2Fhello.component.ts). Your cogs can be defined in one library then used in either framework (yes I know React isn't a framework). In both examples you will see a cogs.js file. This file is your library and is identical and will work with both react and angular.

## Commands

```
yarn build  # Build files from src/ into dist/

yarn clean  # Delete all files in dist/
```
