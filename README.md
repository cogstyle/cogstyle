Your keys, values and cogs are defined in a style library. That library can then be used with cogs in any of the frameworks we support (React, Vue, Angular). In most examples will be a stylelibrary.js file. If you were developing a set of components for each framework then you would be able to use the same set of composable keys, values and props to build those components. We have examples for each framework above.

## Commands

```
yarn build  # Build files from src/ into dist/

yarn clean  # Delete all files in dist/
```
